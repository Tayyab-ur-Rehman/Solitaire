# Solitaire ðŸŽ´ (C++ with SFML)

A classic **Klondike Solitaire** game written in **Modern C++**, using **SFML** for window handling, graphics, input, and audio.  
Designed as a data structures & algorithms project at ITU, this version replaces the terminal-only implementation and brings graphical polish to your card-based logic.
